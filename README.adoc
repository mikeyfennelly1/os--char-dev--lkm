_*O*perating *S*ystems, *Char*acter *Dev*ice, *L*oadable *K*ernel *M*odule_

This is a character device gets system information from kernel space, and returns it as a byte stream of JSON.

There is a userspace application that is a demo of this. The link to that is on this repo under the the About section on the sidebar.

== Usage

1. cpu
2. disk
3. memory
